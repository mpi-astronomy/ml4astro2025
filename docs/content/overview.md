The workshop's theme is the application of machine learning to solve astrophysical problems. This event will be a one-day workshop and unconference, where we will discuss and learn from each other about applying techniques to solve very similar problems in various contexts. We hope this workshop could lead to some new collaborations or initial joint studies. We will dedicate a significant amount of time to unconference sessions and informal discussions.
