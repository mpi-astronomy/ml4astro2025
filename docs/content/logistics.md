## <i class="fa-solid fa-universal-access"></i> Accessibility

We are committed to providing an accessible environment for all participants. If you need help or arrangements, don't hesitate to contact the organizers (or provide information through the registration form).

Participants will pay attention not to leave out information for some people in your audience.
Some of us might not be able to see well, hear well, move well, speak well, or understand information presented in some ways well or at all.
Everyone at the event will be open to diversity in the audience and any accessibility issues.
The [Web Accessibility Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/teach-advocate/accessible-presentations/) provides some information & directions.
